# A02: Clubs

You must create two components (Query and CRUD) based on the following database tables. You will create the entities by using reverse engineering.

![ERD for A02](./A02.png)

## Query

> **Clubs by Active Status** - Search with Tabular Results

Display the results of looking up Clubs by their active status (active/non-active). Display the employee full name or "No Staff" for the employee. Follow the mock-up below as a guide to displaying the results. This mock-up demonstrates pagination. Remember you may also use tabular scrolling to limit the number of lines displayed.

**Future Deliverable Implementation Note**: Each club line will contain a link to allow for record maintenance. This link will cause your CRUD component to appear. Add a separate New button to have your CRUD appear.

## CRUD

> **Clubs** - Single Item Create/Read/Update/Deactivate (Delete)

Note the following:

- `Club` entries are **not** deleted. Rather than providing a "delete" button, inlude a "Deactivate" button and in the BLL method, change the `Active` flag to `false` and update the database for that entry.
- For entering the employee id of available staff, use an `<select>`. The seelct list is based the results of a query returning only employees who are instructors, office administrator or technical support.


**Queries**

Employee Club List

Create a query that will return an ordered list of Employees who are currently associated with a club. Order the list by last name.

```csharp
_context.Employees
        .Where(x => x.Clubs.Any(y => x.EmployeeId == y.EmployeeId))
        .OrderBy(x => x.LastName)
```

Club by Status

Create a query that will return an ordered list of Clubs depending on the Active status. Order the list by clubname.

```csharp
_context.Clubs
        .Where(x => x.Active == active)
        .OrderBy(x => x.ClubName)
```

Note: The radio button supplied a string, your service will need code to set a local boolean variable (active). 

Club by ID

Create a query that will return a club given a club id.

```csharp
_context.Clubs
        .Where(x => x.ClubID.Equals(clubid))
        .FirstOrDefault()
```

Available Staff for Clubs

Create a query that will return an ordered list of Employees who are currently in one of the following positions: instructors, office administrator or technical support. Order the list by last name.

```csharp
_context.Employee
        .Where(x => x.PositionId == 3 || x.PositionId == 4 || x.PositionId == 5)
        .OrderBy(x => x.LastName);
```

**Entity Employee Entity**

Add the following to the entity for use in your application:

```csharp
[NotMapped]
public string FullName { get {return LastName + ', ' + Firstname;}}
```
